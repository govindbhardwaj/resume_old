  I love what I do...

<div style="text-align: justify">
Simply, I love my work. It’s creative. It requires deep thinking and rewards you with a sense of being able to do something that most of the people you meet each day can’t imagine being able to do.Software development is both challenging and rewarding. It’s creative like an art-form, but (unlike art) it provides concrete, measurable value. Love to play guitar in free time...

> Happy Coding!
